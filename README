The `matlab-prettifier' package allows you to effortlessly prettyprint
Matlab source code in documents typeset with LaTeX & friends. Built on top
of the `listings' package, it defines a language called `Matlab-pretty',
which can be invoked by `listings' macros and environments and can be used
in conjunction with (most) parameters provided by the `listings' package.
Fine-tuning of the output is possible via a number of special-purpose keys
extending those defined by `listings'. The `matlab-prettifier' package
also conveniently provides three predefined styles, for fast deployment.
